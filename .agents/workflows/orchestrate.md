# MANDATORY RULES: VIOLATION IS FORBIDDEN

- **Response language follows `language` setting in `.agents/oma-config.yaml` if configured.**
- **NEVER skip steps.** Execute from Step 0 in order. Explicitly report completion of each step before proceeding.
- **You MUST use MCP tools throughout the entire workflow.** This is NOT optional.
  - Use code analysis tools (`get_symbols_overview`, `find_symbol`, `find_referencing_symbols`, `search_for_pattern`) for code exploration.
  - Use memory tools (read/write/edit) for progress tracking.
  - Memory path: configurable via `memoryConfig.basePath` (default: `.serena/memories`)
  - Tool names: configurable via `memoryConfig.tools` in `mcp.json`
  - Do NOT use raw file reads or grep as substitutes. MCP tools are the primary interface.
- **Read required documents BEFORE starting.**

---

## Vendor Detection

Before starting, determine your runtime environment by following `.agents/skills/_shared/core/vendor-detection.md`.
The detected runtime vendor and each agent's target vendor determine how agents are spawned (Step 3) and monitored (Step 4).

---

## Step 0: Preparation (DO NOT SKIP)

1. Read `.agents/skills/oma-coordination/SKILL.md` and confirm Core Rules.
2. Read `.agents/skills/_shared/core/context-loading.md` for resource loading strategy.
3. Read `.agents/skills/_shared/runtime/memory-protocol.md` for memory protocol.
4. Read `.agents/skills/_shared/runtime/event-spec.md` for L1 event protocol.
5. Define the `oma_emit` helper for required L1 decisions:
   ```bash
   oma_emit() {
     kind="$1"
     payload="$2"
     oma emit "$kind" "$payload"
   }
   ```

---

## Step 1: Load or Create Plan

Look for a plan file:

1. Check `.agents/results/plan-{sessionId}.json` (current session's plan).
2. If not found: find the most recent `.agents/results/plan-*.json` file.
3. If none exist: ask the user to run `/plan` first, or ask them to describe the tasks to execute.
- **Do NOT proceed without a plan.**

---

## Step 2: Initialize Session

// turbo

1. 설정 파일 로드:
   - `.agents/oma-config.yaml` (언어, CLI 매핑)
2. CLI 매핑 현황 표시:

   ```
   CLI 에이전트 매핑
   ┌──────────┬─────────┐
   │ Agent    │ CLI     │
   ├──────────┼─────────┤
   │ frontend │ codex   │
   │ backend  │ codex   │
   │ mobile   │ claude  │
   │ pm       │ claude  │
   └──────────┴─────────┘
   ```

3. Generate session ID (format: `session-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`).
4. Use memory write tool to create `orchestrator-session.md` and `task-board.md` in the memory base path.
5. Set session status to RUNNING.

---

## Step 3: Spawn Agents by Priority Tier

// turbo
Before spawning agents, emit and verify the required fan-out decision:

```bash
oma_emit "decision.made" '{"subject":"orchestrate.fanout-strategy","decision":"Spawn agents by priority tier using the loaded plan.","rationale":"The plan is available and determines which agents run in parallel."}'
oma state:verify-decisions --workflow orchestrate --checkpoint fanout-strategy
```

For each priority tier (P0 first, then P1, etc.):

- Each agent gets: task description, API contracts, relevant context from `_shared/core/context-loading.md`.
- Use memory edit tool to update `task-board.md` with agent status.

### Per-Agent Dispatch

For each planned agent, first resolve the target vendor from `.agents/oma-config.yaml`.

- If `target_vendor === current_runtime_vendor` and that runtime has a verified native role-subagent path, use the native vendor variant agent definition.
- Otherwise, use `oma agent:spawn` for that agent only.

### If Claude Code and target vendor is Claude

Spawn agents via **Agent tool** using `.claude/agents/{agent}.md` definitions.

- **Multiple Agent tool calls in same message** = true parallel execution
- Agent mapping:

| Domain | Subagent File |
|:------|:---------------|
| backend | `.claude/agents/backend-engineer.md` |
| frontend | `.claude/agents/frontend-engineer.md` |
| mobile | `.claude/agents/mobile-engineer.md` |
| db | `.claude/agents/db-engineer.md` |
| qa | `.claude/agents/qa-reviewer.md` |
| debug | `.claude/agents/debug-investigator.md` |
| pm | `.claude/agents/pm-planner.md` |
| architecture | `.claude/agents/architecture-reviewer.md` |
| tf-infra | `.claude/agents/tf-infra-engineer.md` |
| docs | `.claude/agents/docs-curator.md` |

- Include API contracts from `.agents/skills/_shared/core/api-contracts/` if they exist
- Load only task-relevant context (check codebase structure around affected domains)

### If Codex CLI and target vendor is Codex

Spawn native Codex custom agents using `.codex/agents/{agent}.toml` when available.
Pass each agent its task description, API contracts, and relevant context.
If native dispatch is not verified in the current runtime, fall back to `oma agent:spawn {agent_id} {prompt_file} {session_id} -w {workspace}`.

### If Gemini CLI and target vendor is Gemini

Spawn native Gemini subagents using `.gemini/agents/{agent}.md` when available.
If native dispatch is not verified in the current runtime, fall back to `oma agent:spawn {agent_id} {prompt_file} {session_id} -w {workspace}`.

### If target vendor differs from current runtime, or native dispatch is unavailable

Spawn agents using `oma agent:spawn {agent_id} {prompt_file} {session_id} -w {workspace}` only (custom subagents not available).

---

## Step 4: Monitor Progress

Use `oma agent:status {session_id} {agent_id}` to check process health.
Also use memory read tool to poll `progress-{agent}.md` for logic updates.

- Use memory edit tool to update `task-board.md` with turn counts and status changes.
- Watch for: completion, failures, crashes.

### Context Anxiety Check (per polling cycle)

At each poll, evaluate for every in-progress agent:

1. **Turn budget ratio**: `turns_used / expected_turns` from difficulty guide
2. **Progress ratio**: `completed_criteria / total_criteria` from task-board

| Turn Budget | Progress | Action |
|-------------|----------|--------|
| < 80% | any | Continue monitoring |
| >= 80% | >= 50% | Continue (agent is on track to finish) |
| >= 80% | < 50% | **Context Reset**: Checkpoint + re-spawn (see `_shared/core/context-budget.md`) |
| 100% (max turns) | < 100% | **Context Reset**: Force checkpoint + re-spawn with remaining items |

Record reset events in `task-board.md`:
```
| Agent | Status | Note |
| backend | reset-1 | Turn budget 80%, progress 40%, checkpoint saved |
```

> **Claude Code note**: Agent tool returns results synchronously, so no polling is needed. Check status, files changed, and issues directly in each agent's return value.

---

## Step 5: Verify Completed Agents

// turbo
For each completed agent, run automated verification:

```
bash .agents/skills/oma-orchestrator/scripts/verify.sh {agent-type} {workspace}
```

- PASS (exit 0): accept result. If Quality Score is active, measure and record in Experiment Ledger.
- FAIL (exit 1): Before re-spawning, apply the Review Loop termination check:

  > **Review Loop termination conditions** (OR, whichever fires first wins):
  > 1. Retry count for this agent has reached the configured maximum (default: 2 retries). Do not start another retry cycle.
  > 2. Session cost cap exceeded: call `checkCap(sessionId, loadQuotaCap())` from `cli/io/session-cost.ts`. If `exceeded === true`, print `formatPromptMessage(result)` to the user and stop the loop immediately. Save the current agent's partial results before stopping, then report early termination due to quota. Do not spawn the next retry or any remaining agents in the tier.
  >
  > If neither condition is met, re-spawn the agent with error context and increment the retry counter.

- FAIL (after 2 retries, and cost cap not yet exceeded): Activate **Exploration Loop** (load `exploration-loop.md` per `context-loading.md`):
  1. Generate 2-3 alternative hypotheses for the failing task
  2. Spawn the **same agent type** with different hypothesis prompts (parallel, separate workspaces)
  3. Score each result with Quality Score (if available)
  4. Keep the highest-scoring approach, discard others
  5. Record all experiments in Experiment Ledger

---

## Step 6: Collect Results

// turbo
After all agents complete, use memory read tool to read all `result-{agent}-{sessionId}.md` files.
Compile summary: completed tasks, failed tasks, files changed, remaining issues.

Emit and verify the required QA verdict decision before the final report:

```bash
oma_emit "decision.made" '{"subject":"orchestrate.qa-verdict","decision":"Accept completed agents or record change requests.","rationale":"Agent verification results have been collected and classified."}'
oma state:verify-decisions --workflow orchestrate --checkpoint qa-verdict
```

---

## Step 7: Final Report

Present session summary to the user.

- If any tasks failed after retries, list them with error details.
- Suggest next steps: manual fix, re-run specific agents, or run `/review` for QA.
- Use memory write tool to record final results.
- If Quality Score was measured during this session:
  - Generate Experiment Ledger summary (total experiments, keep rate, net delta)
  - Auto-generate lessons from discarded experiments (delta <= -5) into `lessons-learned.md`
  - Include agent effectiveness ranking in the report
