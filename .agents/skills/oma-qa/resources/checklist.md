- Use Chrome DevTools MCP (`new_page` with `isolatedContext: "qa-test"`) for runtime verification and E2E testing
- Document all findings with file:line references
- Provide remediation code examples
- Estimate fix time for each issue

## Runtime Verification (after static review)

Record results in the structured table format defined in `execution-protocol.md` Step 2.5 (Recording Results).

- [ ] Application starts without errors
- [ ] All modified endpoints return expected status codes; verify with `list_network_requests()`
- [ ] Form submissions produce correct database state; verify with `fill_form()` + `list_network_requests()`
- [ ] Error states render user-friendly messages (not stack traces); verify with `take_snapshot()` on error paths
- [ ] Empty/loading/error UI states all handled; verify with `navigate_page()` to empty state routes + `take_snapshot()`
- [ ] Interactive elements respond to input (not display-only); verify with `click(uid)` + `take_snapshot()` before/after
- [ ] Auth flows work end-to-end (register → login → protected route → logout); verify with sequential `fill()` + `click()` + `list_network_requests()`
- [ ] Rate limiting / throttling triggers at configured thresholds; verify with rapid `evaluate_script(fetch)` calls
- [ ] File upload/download actually transfers data (not stubbed); verify with `upload_file(uid, filePath)` + response check
- [ ] Pagination returns correct pages (not always page 1); verify with `click()` page 2 + `take_snapshot()` to confirm different content
- [ ] Zero JS console errors on critical paths; verify with `list_console_messages(types: ["error"])`
