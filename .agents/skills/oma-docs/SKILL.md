# oma-docs - Documentation Drift Detector

## Scheduling

### Goal
Detect broken references in `docs/**/*.md` (verify mode) and propose LLM-generated patch proposals for docs affected by recent code changes (sync mode). Both modes run on-demand; sync is always interactive.

### Intent signature
- User asks to check if docs are up to date, find broken doc links, verify file paths referenced in docs, or detect documentation drift.
- User asks to update docs after a code change, propose doc patches for a git diff, or sync affected docs.
- A workflow hook checks `docs.auto_verify: true` and runs `oma docs verify --json` at completion.

### When to use
- After a refactor, rename, or file deletion, to find stale references in docs.
- Before a release, to confirm that CLI commands, file paths, and config keys in docs still exist.
- After a significant git diff, to discover which docs reference the changed files and may need updating.
- Routine drift check on any docs-heavy repo.

### When NOT to use
- Generating docs from scratch for undocumented features → v2 create mode.
- Multilingual translation of docs → use `oma-translator`.
- Symbol-level semantic drift (function signature changes not reflected in prose) → v2 L3 mode.
- CI-blocking enforcement → v2 block mode (v1 is warn-only).

### Expected inputs

**verify mode**: Optional glob path (default `**/*.md`), optional `--json` flag, optional `--report-file <path>`.

**sync mode**: Optional git diff range (default `--cached`, fallback `HEAD~1..HEAD`).

### Expected outputs

**verify mode**:
- Markdown drift report to stdout (default), or raw JSON with `--json`, or full markdown written to file with `--report-file`.
- Exit code 0 if clean, 1 if any broken refs found.

**sync mode**:
- Interactive per-doc patch proposals with `[y] apply [n] skip [d] diff [s] full proposal` prompts.
- Docs modified only on explicit user approval; `doc-refs.json` regenerated after applies.

### Dependencies
- `cli/commands/docs/extract.ts`: markdown AST + L2 pattern extractor.
- `cli/commands/docs/resolve.ts`: deterministic broken-ref checker.
- `cli/commands/docs/reporter.ts`: deterministic markdown/JSON report renderer (no LLM call; host LLM does narrative synthesis).
- `cli/commands/docs/sync-propose.ts`: git diff intake, reverse lookup, candidate-doc selector with secret redaction (no LLM call; host LLM drafts patches).
- `docs/generated/doc-refs.json`: single-direction reference index (git-tracked, regenerated on every verify run).
- `docs/generated/url-drift.json`: lychee-produced URL drift report (written by background lychee spawn; gitignored or tracked at user discretion).
- `lychee`: external Rust tool for URL link checking. Detected on PATH; install via `brew install lychee` or see https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee#installation. Optional but recommended.
- `.agents/oma-config.yaml`: `docs.auto_verify` (workflow hook opt-in) and `docs.check_urls` (URL checking on/off, default true) toggles.

### Control-flow features
- Mode is selected from the first argument: `verify` or `sync`.
- verify: extract → resolve → report (deterministic; LLM used only in reporter summary, gracefully skipped when unavailable).
- sync: git diff → reverse lookup → LLM proposals → interactive accept/reject.
- Branches on `--json`, `--report-file`, LLM availability, and network reachability.
- Never blocks workflow completion in v1 (warn-only hook policy).

## Structural Flow

### Entry
1. Read first argument to select mode (`verify` | `sync`). If absent, print help and exit.
2. Load `oma-config.yaml` to check `docs.auto_verify` when invoked from a workflow hook.
3. Confirm required CLI dependencies (`oma docs verify`, `oma docs sync`) are on PATH.

### Scenes
1. **PREPARE**: Determine mode, resolve path/diff-range arguments, confirm tool availability.
2. **ACQUIRE**: Run extractor (`extract.ts`) to regenerate `doc-refs.json` from `docs/**/*.md` (verify) or build in-memory reverse index from existing `doc-refs.json` (sync).
3. **REASON**: Resolve each reference deterministically (verify) or correlate changed files to candidate docs via reverse lookup (sync).
4. **ACT**: Render the deterministic drift report (verify) or list candidate docs with matched refs (sync). Host LLM does any natural-language synthesis or patch drafting on top of this output.
5. **VERIFY**: Confirm output shape is valid (JSON schema check for `--json`; structured candidate list for sync).
6. **FINALIZE**: Print to stdout, write report file if requested, emit exit code.

### Transitions
- verify mode: PREPARE → ACQUIRE (extract) → REASON (resolve) → ACT (report) → FINALIZE.
- sync mode: PREPARE → ACQUIRE (reverse index) → REASON (candidate matching) → ACT (LLM proposals) → VERIFY (interactive) → FINALIZE (apply approved).
- If LLM is unavailable in verify: skip reporter summary, emit raw JSON drift report.
- If LLM is unavailable in sync: emit candidate-list-only output (no patch proposals); user reviews manually.
- If `doc-refs.json` is stale or missing in sync: run extractor first, then continue.

### Failure and recovery
- Extractor parse error on a single doc: skip doc + warn, continue with remaining docs.
- Resolver network timeout on URL refs: mark as `verify-skipped: unreachable`, continue.
- LLM token limit exceeded: fall back to per-doc batching; if still exceeded, fall back to raw JSON.
- `oma docs` CLI not found: skip with installation hint (workflow hook: skip silently).
- `doc-refs.json` write failure: abort and report the write error; do not emit partial index.

### Exit
- Success (verify): drift report emitted; exit 0 if clean, exit 1 if broken refs found.
- Success (sync): approved patches applied; `doc-refs.json` regenerated; session summary printed.
- Partial success: extractor or resolver errors are explicit in the report; no silent failures.

## Logical Operations

### Actions
| Action | SSL primitive | Notes |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| Parse CLI args and mode | `READ` | First arg selects verify or sync |
| Extract refs from docs | `CALL_TOOL` | `extract.ts`: remark AST + L2 patterns → `doc-refs.json` |
| Check broken refs | `RESOLVE` | `resolve.ts`: file, url, cli, script, env, config checks |
| Build reverse index | `INFER` | `sync-propose.ts`: in-memory map from `doc-refs.json` |
| Match diff to candidate docs | `RESOLVE` | `sync-propose.ts`: git diff + reverse lookup |
| Redact secrets from diff | `VALIDATE` | Exclude `.env*`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `id_rsa*`; sanitize content |
| Generate patch proposals | `CALL_TOOL` | `sync-propose.ts` + `llm.ts`: per-doc LLM calls |
| Render drift report | `RENDER` | `reporter.ts`: markdown (default), JSON (`--json`), file (`--report-file`) |
| Apply approved patches | `WRITE` | `git apply` on user-confirmed patches only |
| Notify hook summary | `NOTIFY` | 1-3 line stdout summary for workflow hooks |

### Tools and instruments
- `cli/commands/docs/extract.ts`: `remark` + `unified` markdown AST, L2 pattern extraction, escape hatch filter, `docs/generated/doc-refs.json` writer.
- `cli/commands/docs/resolve.ts`: case-sensitive file existence, `which` for CLI tokens, `package.json` scripts lookup, ripgrep/git grep for env vars, `oma-config.yaml` deep-path check. Per-target dedupe caches (cli by first token, env, config) and per-directory listing cache for file resolution. URL kind is filtered out by the verify command and delegated to lychee.
- `cli/commands/docs/reporter.ts`: deterministic markdown + JSON renderer. **No LLM call.** Friendly summary, severity tagging, fix prioritization are the host LLM's responsibility.
- `cli/commands/docs/sync-propose.ts`: git diff intake, reverse index build, secret-pattern + gitignore file exclusion. Returns candidate docs with matched refs only. **No LLM call.** Patch synthesis is the host LLM's responsibility.
- External: [`lychee`](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee) (background URL link checking; install via `brew install lychee`).

### Host-LLM contract

This skill follows the OMA pattern (mirroring `oma-scholar`): **the CLI emits structured data; the host LLM (the agent runtime that invoked the skill) does any natural-language synthesis or judgment.**

After `oma docs verify --json`:
1. Read the JSON drift report.
2. Group findings by severity / urgency (host-LLM judgment).
3. Suggest fixes per finding, prioritizing files most central to the project.
4. If the user asks for natural-language summary, host LLM produces it from the JSON, never from cached prose.

After `oma docs sync <range> --json`:
1. Read the candidate doc list (each entry: `{ doc, changedFiles, matchedRefs }`).
2. For each candidate doc: read the doc itself, read `git diff` for `changedFiles`, draft a unified-diff patch reflecting the code change.
3. Present patches to the user for review. **Never auto-apply.**
4. On user approval, apply via `git apply` or by writing the doc directly.

### Canonical command path

**verify mode** runs a drift check against the current codebase:

```bash
# Default: scan all docs/**/*.md, render markdown to stdout.
# URL link checking is delegated to lychee in the background
# (install: `brew install lychee`). Core check ~8s on a 1k-doc repo.
oma docs verify

# Narrow to a path or glob (uses minimatch)
oma docs verify "docs/**/*.md"
oma docs verify cli/README.md

# Machine-readable output for CI / hooks
oma docs verify --json

# Persist full markdown report to a file
oma docs verify --report-file ./drift-report.md

# Skip URL checking entirely (when lychee is run separately, or as a
# one-off override of docs.check_urls=true in oma-config.yaml)
oma docs verify --no-urls

# Block until lychee finishes (CI scenarios needing complete URL data)
oma docs verify --urls-sync

# Exit code: 0 = clean, 1 = broken refs found in core check.
# URL drift, if any, is reported separately at docs/generated/url-drift.json
# and does NOT affect this exit code.
```

**sync mode** proposes patches for docs affected by a git diff (always interactive, never auto-applies):

```bash
# Default: staged changes (--cached), fallback HEAD~1..HEAD
oma docs sync

# Explicit range
oma docs sync HEAD~5..HEAD
oma docs sync main..feature-branch

# Per-doc prompt: [y] apply  [n] skip  [d] show diff  [s] show full proposal
# Sync regenerates docs/generated/doc-refs.json after applying any patches.
```

**Workflow hook (opt-in)** runs verify automatically at workflow completion when `docs.auto_verify: true` in `oma-config.yaml`:

```bash
# Hook command emitted by /scm, /work, /ultrawork
oma docs verify --json
# Hook policy: warn-only in v1; non-zero exit does NOT block workflow completion
```

### Resource scope
| Scope | Resource target |
|-------|-----------------|
| `LOCAL_FS` read | `docs/**/*.md` (extractor input), `docs/generated/doc-refs.json` (index), `.env.example`, `package.json`, `.agents/oma-config.yaml` |
| `LOCAL_FS` write | `docs/generated/doc-refs.json` (regenerated each verify run), approved sync patches |
| `CODEBASE` read-only | Existence checks for file/cli/script/env/config refs; git diff intake |
| `PROCESS` | `git diff`, `git apply`, `which`, HTTP HEAD requests |
| `NETWORK` | URL ref HEAD requests (external hosts only; internal hosts skipped) |

### Preconditions
- `docs/` directory exists at repo root.
- `cli/commands/docs/` is built and `oma` binary is on PATH (or invoked directly via `bun run`).
- For sync mode: a git diff is available (`--cached` stage or recent commits).

### Effects and side effects
- verify: regenerates `docs/generated/doc-refs.json` (always overwrites).
- sync: modifies docs files only on user approval; regenerates `doc-refs.json` after applies.
- Both modes: stdout output (summary or full report).
- No `.agents/` files are ever modified.

### Guardrails

1. **Never modify `.agents/`**: CLAUDE.md SSOT protection applies in all modes.
2. **Never auto-apply sync patches**: sync is always interactive; `[y]` confirm required per doc.
3. **LLM unavailable → graceful degradation**: verify falls back to raw JSON; sync falls back to candidate-list-only (no proposals). Neither mode blocks on LLM availability.
4. **Response language follows `oma-config.yaml` `language`**: user-facing report text is localized; code, paths, JSON keys, and CLI commands stay in English.
5. **Secret-bearing files excluded from sync output**: `.env*`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `id_rsa*`, and gitignored files never appear in candidate `changedFiles` lists. Host LLM never sees secret file paths.
6. **URL link checking delegated to lychee**: when `docs.check_urls=true` (default), URL refs are checked by `lychee` running in the background; results land in `docs/generated/url-drift.json`. If `lychee` is missing, an install hint is printed and URL checking is skipped (no internal HEAD fallback).
7. **No direct LLM API calls from the CLI**: the CLI never imports vendor SDKs, never reads API keys, never makes outbound LLM requests. All synthesis, patch drafting, and natural-language framing is the host LLM's responsibility (mirrors `oma-scholar`'s pattern). This makes `oma-docs` vendor-agnostic: works identically under Claude Code / Codex / Gemini / Qwen / Antigravity.
7. **Hook is warn-only in v1**: broken refs never block workflow completion; `docs.auto_verify: false` by default (explicit opt-in required).
8. **Escape hatch respected**: `<!-- oma-docs:ignore-start -->` / `<!-- oma-docs:ignore-end -->` blocks and frontmatter `oma-docs: skip` are honored; no ref extraction from ignored regions.

### v1 scope note
v1 covers `verify` and `sync` (broken-only classification, L2 ref extraction). The following are explicitly deferred to v2: `create` mode (generate missing docs), multilingual sync (deeper `oma-translator` integration), L3 symbol-level extraction (Tree-sitter/LSP), GitHub Action wrapper, `block` hook mode.
